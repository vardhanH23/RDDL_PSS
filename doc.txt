Introduction
The SwaggerUI is an interactive documentation of the RESTful API, which serves two main purposes:

It provides the REST API documentation
It provides an interactive interface to communicate with the REST API
Prerequisites
In order to interact with the RDDLTST REST API on Swagger UI, you would need to be part of an R&D Data Lake Project

Setup a new project in R&D Data Lake Project Space
Usage
Get the Access token
Click here to expand...
Open the Swagger UI URL
Click on the GET endpoint /auth/token


Click on Try it out


Click on Execute


Copy the server response and proceed with Set Authentication credentials 


Set Authentication credentials
Click here to expand...
Click on the Authorize button



A form would appear. In the value field of BearerAuth, paste the access token you have received earlier.

Click Authorize



Click Close



Upload an Artifact
Click here to expand...
Click on the POST method with endpoint projects/{projectKey}/artifacts



Click Try it out

Fill out the required fields (red)
projectKey: A valid project in the R&D Data Lake Application
Filename: Specify any name for the uploaded file
Metadata: A JSON data structure consisting of keys and values
Known Limitation: Swagger only supports ISO 8859-1 encoding for header parameters. Other RDDL clients and the frontend support the full utf-8 encoding for metadata in the header as well.
In case you want to upload special characters in the RDDL Swagger, upload the file first without any metadata and then use the 'Add Version' endpoint with the special character metadata as part of the request body.

Request body: Choose a file that you want to upload to Data Lake



Optional: Fill out additional fields (yellow)
Schema: A valid schema, which was previously added to the project. Will be verified on the metadata
waitForIngest: If set to true, the request will wait till metadata is ingested

Click the Execute button



Check the response code, 201 means that the file has been successfully uploaded
